            <h2>Anand</h2>
            <p class="box" style="border-style: dashed;">Anand (P.Sachidanandan), born in 1936 in Irinjalakuda in Trichur district in Kerala is an eminent Malayalam fiction writer and essayist, whose fiction reads almost like texts of high philosophy. His works do not conform exactly to any of the fictional forms currently in vogue. Anand has consistently tried to explore in his fiction fundamental issues of power, justice and the human condition. A major recurring theme in most of Anand's works is the way power and its various abusive manifestations inflict torturous pain and suffering on common people. The process of people coming to terms with this suffering over and over again appears in his works as an historical pattern. Some of his works betray a Kafkaesque streak. His works also demonstrate a deep sense of history, using not only personalities and events from the past, but also reflecting continuously on the lessons that the past teaches us. While denouncing the abuse of power, Anand does not advocate the overthrow of the institutions of power, for instance the state. He strikes a middle path that argues for more sensitization and conscientization of the institutions of power. A radical humanist, inspired by the ideas of M. N. Roy in his early years, Anand is ill at ease with all varieties of absolutist tendencies.</p>

            <h2>Paul Zacharia</h2>
            <p class="box" style="border-style: dotted;">Non-conformist and unorthodox to the core, Paul Zacharia, the eminent Malayalam fiction writer and essayist, was born in 1945 in Kottayam district in Kerala. His short stories and novels, pathbreaking and unconventional in style and theme, are marked by a deep sense of humor, experiments in craft and narrative techniques, and an unsentimental prose. His uncompromising stand and open opposition to the forces he perceives to be communal, retrogressive and reactionary make him a controversial public intellectual who is regularly in the media. As a socially and politically committed and engaged writer, Zacharia scoffs at fellow writers who see themselves in isolation from society, provoking those who remain silent on vital social and political issues of the day to use their literature for social purpose.
                    Considered one of the most important Indian writers living today, his works have been translated into English and other languages. He is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award and Katha Award.
                    The Library of Congress has in its collection thirteen books by him.</p>

            <h2>Satchidanandan</h2>
            <p>Satchidanandan, poet, critic and Secretary of the Sahitya Akademi, is one of the best-known literary personalities in India. He was born on 28th May 1946 at Pullut in Thrissur district in Kerala. A poet of intense political and ethical sensitivity, Satchidanandan achieves a fine balance between the cerebral, the visceral, and the emotional in his poetry. While the subtle and the nuanced expressions in his poetry appealed to the literary sensibilities of more enlightened and refined connoisseurs of poetry, its indignant tone and tenor combined with its ardent humanism and emancipatory vision appealed to a wider public. Although his literary criticism draws on complex theory, it is approachable and has introduced Malayalis to contemporary trends in all fields of knowledge. A true globetrotter who has participated in numerous poetry festivals and literary meets in different parts of the world, Satchidanandan is the recipient of many prestigious awards, including the Sahitya Akademi Award and Oman Cultural Centre Award. The Library of Congress has thirty-three books by Satchidanandan, in both Malayalam and English.</p>

            <h2>Balachandran</h2>
            <p  >Balachandran Chullikad, one of India's most admired and respected living poets, was born on July, 1957 at Paravoor, a small town in Ernakulam District in Kerala. Throughout his school years, he devoted himself to poetry. By early adolescence his creative energy and poetic gifts showed in a poetry that displayed an unusual maturity and openness that questioned the dominant aesthetics which was saturated with romantic lyricism and conventional symbolism, and enabled the start of a free flowing subjective poetic tradition. Years before his first book of poems (Patinettukavitakal, 1982) was published he became the most sought after and quoted poet of Kerala thanks to the poetry festivals and university cultural functions that encouraged bold creative experiments by young poets. Nurtured in the grand epics of India as well as the canons of international modernism, Chullikad stands in the forefront of a generation of poets who wanted to invent a new poetic language.</p>

            <p >M. T. Vasudevan Nair, one of the most respected Indian writers today, was born on August 15, 1934 in Kudallur, a small village in Palakkad district, Kerala. He rose to eminence through his well-crafted novels and short stories in Malayalam whose romantic poignancy and tender portrayal of the human condition endeared the author to his readers. He captured in subtle detail the pain and anguish that marked the ebb of feudalism in Kerala in many of his novels. A master storyteller, M.T made his way up to be honored with the highest literary award the nation confers on a writer, the Jnanpith in 1995. Prior to that, he had received many awards and accolades like both state and center Sahitya Akademi Awards.

A novel of manners, it follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness.
                            Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, bu1t his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a primary motivation driving the plot.

                    <p class="outline">The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.
                        The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named Celestial Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.

                    <p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in June 1960 and became instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.
                        Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and

In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.</p>

                    <p style="width:1300px;height: 200px;">Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, Little Women. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.
                        It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>
