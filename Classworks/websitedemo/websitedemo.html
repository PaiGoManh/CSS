            <h2>Satchidanandan</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Satchidanandan, poet, critic and Secretary of the Sahitya Akademi, is one of the best-known literary personalities in India. He was born on 28th May 1946 at Pullut in Thrissur district in Kerala. A poet of intense political and ethical sensitivity, Satchidanandan achieves a fine balance between the cerebral, the visceral, and the emotional in his poetry. While the subtle and the nuanced expressions in his poetry appealed to the literary sensibilities of more enlightened and refined connoisseurs of poetry, its indignant tone and tenor combined with its ardent humanism and emancipatory vision appealed to a wider public. Although his literary criticism draws on complex theory, it is approachable and has introduced Malayalis to contemporary trends in all fields of knowledge. A true globetrotter who has participated in numerous poetry festivals and literary meets in different parts of the world, Satchidanandan is the recipient of many prestigious awards, including the Sahitya Akademi Award and Oman Cultural Centre Award. The Library of Congress has thirty-three books by Satchidanandan, in both Malayalam and English.</p>

            <h2>Balachandran</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">Balachandran Chullikad, one of India's most admired and respected living poets, was born on July, 1957 at Paravoor, a small town in Ernakulam District in Kerala. Throughout his school years, he devoted himself to poetry. By early adolescence his creative energy and poetic gifts showed in a poetry that displayed an unusual maturity and openness that questioned the dominant aesthetics which was saturated with romantic lyricism and conventional symbolism, and enabled the start of a free flowing subjective poetic tradition. Years before his first book of poems (Patinettukavitakal, 1982) was published he became the most sought after and quoted poet of Kerala thanks to the poetry festivals and university cultural functions that encouraged bold creative experiments by young poets. Nurtured in the grand epics of India as well as the canons of international modernism, Chullikad stands in the forefront of a generation of poets who wanted to invent a new poetic language.</p>

            <h2>M. T. Vasudevan Nair</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">M. T. Vasudevan Nair, one of the most respected Indian writers today, was born on August 15, 1934 in Kudallur, a small village in Palakkad district, Kerala. He rose to eminence through his well-crafted novels and short stories in Malayalam whose romantic poignancy and tender portrayal of the human condition endeared the author to his readers. He captured in subtle detail the pain and anguish that marked the ebb of feudalism in Kerala in many of his novels. A master storyteller, M.T made his way up to be honored with the highest literary award the nation confers on a writer, the Jnanpith in 1995. Prior to that, he had received many awards and accolades like both state and center Sahitya Akademi Awards. He occupied and continues to occupy many important and powerful positions in various literary bodies including the presidentship of Kerala Sahitya Akademi and the chairmanship of Tunchan Memorial Trust.</p>
